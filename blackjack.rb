# Game Logic

# Decks: Will I need more than one deck?

# I'll need:
# - At least one deck (A - K, four suits)
# - A way to keep track of the user's name
# - A way to keep track of all cards available and in use
# - A way to force the dealer to deal at least to 17
# - A way to set 21 as the winning hand, and a way to handle 'busts'
# - A loop that allows the player to continue to play until he/she wants to quit
# - A way to keep track of bets and money
# - A way to 'shuffle' the deck

# Implementation
# Array vs. Hash for the cards
# Using randomization                  

# Bonus Features
# - Burning cards
# - doubling down
# - insurance bets
# - splitting
